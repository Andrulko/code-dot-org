Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. Help us by letting us know how much computer science is taught at your school.

Computer science includes computer programming or coding to create software, apps, or games, or control electronics through circuits or robotics. Computer science is NOT using applications on a computer to do everyday things like writing documents, making spreadsheets, creating presentations; using the Internet; or graphic and web design that does not include coding.
